Add Copy functionality to the following:

1. Device > Properties > General > Discovery Data
1. User > Properties > General > Discovery Data
1. Operating System Image > Properties > Images Tab > Image Properties
1. Configuration Baseline > Evaluation Conditions Tab
1. Operating Systems > Drivers > Categories
1. Deployments > Select a Deployment > Asset Details > Copy just the Device name instead of all (this might be me just being picky, but my current workflow to work on a deployment error often involves me using the machine name.  Copying and pasting the whole string of data into notepad then selecting just the device name is one more step that I would like to avoid :)
Add Paste functionality to the following:

1. Devices > Import Computer Information > Import single computer
    - Right click + paste works, but CTRL+V does not.
